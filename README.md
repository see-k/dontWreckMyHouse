### Glossary
- Guest: 
A customer. Someone who wants to book a place to stay. Guest data is provided via a zip download.

- Host:
The accommodation provider. Someone who has a property to rent per night. Host data is provided.

-  Location:
A rental property. In Don't Wreck My House, Location and Host are combined. 
The application enforces a limit on one Location per Host, so we can think of a Host and Location as a single thing.

-  Reservation:
One or more days where a Guest has exclusive access to a Location (or Host). Reservation data is provided.

- Adminstrator:
The application user. Guests and Hosts don't book their own Reservations. The Administrator does it for them.
